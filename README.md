# Information
- Small project in C++ dedicated to making a phone number validation program.
- A program like this would regularly use a regular expression, but this program will solve the problem without it
- Specific requirements for the validation program are listed below
  
# Requirements
- 3-digit area code
- 3-digit exchange code
- 4 additional digits
- The above three are separated by either a '.' or '-' (no mixing)

- -------------

- An extension may be present at the end of a phone number
- It can happen right after the end, or there can be a space between the end and the start of the extension
- Extensions start with an 'x' or 'X'
- 1-4 digits after the 'X' or 'x' need to be present

-------------

- Area codes can be surrounded by parenthesis
- Area codes can not start with a one or zero

 # Remark
 - Yes, I know that this problem would take one line of code to complete using a reg ex (even though it would look atrocious)
 - This is just to show that a problem like this one can be solved without using a regular expression.
